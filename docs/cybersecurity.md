# Cybersecurity Fundamentals

## Core Principles

### CIA Triad
1. **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that information is kept secret from unauthorized access
2. **Integrity**: Maintaining and assuring the accuracy and consistency of data
3. **Availability**: Ensuring that authorized parties can access the information when needed

### Additional Principles
- **Non-repudiation**: Inability to deny having performed an action
- **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of a user, process, or device
- **Authorization**: Determining the access rights of an authenticated entity

## Common Threats

1. **Malware**
   - Viruses
   - Worms
   - Trojans
   - Ransomware
   - Spyware
   - Adware

2. **Social Engineering**
   - Phishing
   - Spear phishing
   - Whaling
   - Baiting
   - Pretexting

3. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks**
4. **Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attacks**
5. **SQL Injection**
6. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
7. **Zero-Day Exploits**
8. **Password Attacks**
   - Brute force
   - Dictionary attacks
   - Rainbow table attacks

## Defense Mechanisms

### Network Security
- Firewalls
- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
- Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)
- Virtual Private Networks (VPN)
- Network Segmentation

### Encryption
- Symmetric encryption: AES, DES
- Asymmetric encryption: RSA, ECC
- Hashing algorithms: SHA-256, bcrypt

### Access Control
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
- Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

### Security Policies and Procedures
- Incident Response Plans
- Business Continuity Planning
- Disaster Recovery
- Security Awareness Training

### Vulnerability Management
- Regular security assessments
- Penetration testing
- Patch management
- Configuration management

## Compliance and Frameworks

- ISO 27001
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
- PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)

## Emerging Technologies in Cybersecurity

- Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for threat detection
- Blockchain for secure transactions and identity management
- Zero Trust Security Model
- Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)
- Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR)

## Career Paths in Cybersecurity
