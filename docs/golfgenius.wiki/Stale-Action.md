The Stale GitHub Action checks daily if there are Issues or Pull Requests with no activity in the past 30 days and marks them with the **stale** label. If the label is not removed in the following 7 days, the Issue/PR is closed.

Be careful when Issues with links to Intercom tickets are marked **stale**. When they are close a message will be sent to the Intercom channel. Make sure you send a reply to the Support team before closing them.

To avoid important Issues/PRs from being marked **stale**, use the **awaiting-decision** label.
