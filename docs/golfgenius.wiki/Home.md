## Engineering Processes

**Git Flow Branching Model**  

| Command | Use case |
| --- | --- |
| `git flow hotfix start` | Push code to production quicker than the general release schedule |
| `git flow feature start` | Regular work for the general release cycle (typically once a month) |

Hotfix Branches are generated in order to push code to production quicker than the general release schedule. They should be reserved for urgent bug fixes or time-sensitive projects. Hotfixes are generated by issuing the `git flow hotfix start` command and will be finalized with a Pull Request to master.

Feature Branches are generated for regular work for the general release cycle (typically once a month). They are generated using the `git flow feature start` command and will be finalized with a Pull Request to develop.

No commits directly in master and develop branches.

**Pull Request Model**  
When branches are ready for review, create a pull request on GitHub. Hotfixes go to master and features go to develop. Add two comments:
* Comment 1: Link to spec, documentation, honeybadger, github issue that has generated this request.
* Comment 2: If pull request over 20 lines of code, copy and paste the code review guidelines and mark each line accordingly.

**On Call Rotation**  
The development team institutes an on-call rotation:
* Resolve unresolved honeybadgers from previous days by looking at GitHub issues.
* Assign honeybadgers that you do not know to solve to a different person.
* Look at e-mails to the developer list and see if there is a bug. Inform the right person for the bug.
