The main statistics can be found in the Master and History sheets of the KPIs spreadsheet. Templates for the charts are located in the Charts sheet. Some information like dates and the History columns need to be updated manually. These charts can then be copied and pasted into the reports.

Weekly reports are posted in the GG-#dev-tickets and TOL-#team-engineering-support Slack channels every Wednesday.
