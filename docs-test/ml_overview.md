# Machine Learning Overview

## Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task through experience. ML algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as "training data," to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task.

## Key Concepts

1. **Supervised Learning**: The algorithm learns from labeled training data, attempting to find a function that best maps input variables to output variables.

2. **Unsupervised Learning**: The algorithm learns from unlabeled data, trying to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in the input data.

3. **Reinforcement Learning**: The algorithm learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.

4. **Deep Learning**: A subset of ML based on artificial neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks).

5. **Feature Extraction**: The process of selecting and transforming raw data into informative representations for ML models.

6. **Overfitting**: When a model learns the training data too well, including noise and fluctuations, leading to poor generalization on new data.

7. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: The process of optimizing the parameters that are not learned from the data but set prior to training.

## Common Algorithms
